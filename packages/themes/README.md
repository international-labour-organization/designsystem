# ILO Design System - Themes Package

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

This package is deprecated and is no longer maintained. Do not install or depend on `@ilo-org/themes` in new or existing projects. Any functionality it previously provided has been migrated into the main design system styles pipeline, and future updates will not be published here.

If you still have a dependency on this package, migrate to the current design system token sources before your next release to avoid breakage.
