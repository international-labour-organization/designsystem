Founded in October 1919 under the League of Nations, it is the first and oldest specialised agency of the UN. The ILO has 187 member states: 186 out of 193 UN member states plus the Cook Islands.</p><figure><img alt='placeholder image' class='right' src='/images/ilo-headquarters.jpg'><figcaption>The ILO's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. ©Steiner SA</figcaption></figure><h2>History and Mission</h2><p>The ILO was established in the aftermath of World War I, recognizing that lasting peace could only be achieved through social justice. Since then, the organization has been pivotal in setting international labor standards, promoting rights at work, encouraging decent employment opportunities, and enhancing social protection. Its tripartite structure brings together governments, employers, and workers from its member states to develop policies and programs.</p><p>Over the past century, the ILO has adapted to the evolving needs of the global workforce, addressing challenges such as child labor, forced labor, and gender inequality. Through its conventions and recommendations, the ILO has become a central force in shaping labor laws and practices that protect workers worldwide, fostering equitable and inclusive economic growth.</p><hr><h3>Key Milestones in ILO History</h3><ol><li>1919: ILO was founded as part of the Treaty of Versailles.</li><li>1946: ILO became the first specialized agency of the United Nations.</li><li>1969: ILO was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</li><li>2019: ILO celebrated its 100th anniversary.</li></ol><h4>ILO’s Mission</h4><ul><li>Promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights.</li><li>Developing labor standards and policies to improve working conditions globally.</li><li>Ensuring employment opportunities and social protection for all workers.</li></ul><h2>Watch: The Mission and Work of the ILO</h2><p>This video provides a visual overview of the ILO's mission, its historical impact, and its ongoing initiatives to improve working conditions and promote social justice across the world.</p><article class='responsive-video-embed'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/55xQTgUJqhQ?si=zhNOlGG5SXWkB2TW' title='YouTube video player' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowfullscreen></iframe></article><blockquote><p>The fundamental ideas that forged the ILO one hundred and three years ago still underpin the global pledge to leave no one behind.</p><cite>ILO Director-General Gilbert F.
