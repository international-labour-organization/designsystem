# ILO Design System Twig Components

Welcome to the ILO Design System Twig Component Library. This resource is designed to help developers build accessible, user friendly websites powered by Drupal or other PHP frameworks that implement the [ILO's Visual Identity](https://brand.ilo.org).

## Getting started

While our components are designed to be used with Drupal, they can also be used with any other project that uses Twig as a template engine. Follow the instructions below to get started:

- [Use with Drupal](/docs/get-started-use-with-drupal--page)
- [Use as an npm package](/docs/get-started-use-npm-package--page)

## Why you should use these components

### Brand compliance

Our components are designed to be fully compliant with the ILO's Visual Identity. This means that you can be confident that your website will be consistent with the ILO's brand guidelines.

### Accessibility

All of our components are designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Responsive RTL layouts

Our components are designed to be fully responsive and adaptive to right-to-left (RTL) layouts for languages such as Arabic.

### Support

Our components are actively maintained and supported by the ILO's Department of Communication. We are committed to providing long-term support for this project including continual updates and improvements. If you have any questions or need help, please [contact us](ilonews@ilo.org).
