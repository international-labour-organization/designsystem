# ILO Design System Twig Components

Welcome to the **ILO Design System Twig Component Library**—a comprehensive collection of reusable, accessible, and brand-compliant components designed to help developers build exceptional websites that align with the [ILO's Visual Identity](https://brand.ilo.org).

Whether you're building a Drupal site or working with any PHP framework that uses Twig as a template engine, this component library provides everything you need to create consistent, accessible, and visually cohesive digital experiences.

## What's included

This library offers a complete set of production-ready components, including:

- **Content components** for displaying text, images, videos, and other media
- **Navigation components** for menus, breadcrumbs, and site structure
- **Form components** for user input and data collection
- **Interactive components** like accordions, modals, and tabs
- **Layout components** for structuring your pages
- **And much more**—all designed to work seamlessly together

Each component is built with accessibility, performance, and maintainability in mind, ensuring your projects meet the highest standards of web development.

## Getting started

Getting started with the ILO Design System is straightforward. Choose the integration method that best fits your project:

- **[Use with Drupal](/docs/get-started-use-with-drupal--page)** — The recommended approach for Drupal projects. Includes a base theme and companion module for seamless integration.

- **[Use as an npm package](/docs/get-started-use-npm-package--page)** — Perfect for custom PHP projects or when you need more control over the implementation.

Both approaches provide access to the same high-quality components, so you can choose what works best for your workflow.

## Why choose the ILO Design System?

### Brand compliance

Our components are meticulously crafted to be fully compliant with the ILO's Visual Identity guidelines. This means you can build websites with confidence, knowing that every element—from typography to color schemes, spacing to interactions—aligns perfectly with the ILO's brand standards. No more guessing about design decisions or worrying about brand consistency.

### Accessibility first

Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's built into every component from the ground up. All components follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines and are designed to be usable by everyone, including users with disabilities. This commitment to accessibility ensures your websites are inclusive and reach the widest possible audience.

### Responsive and RTL-ready

The modern web is diverse, and so are our components. Every component is fully responsive, working beautifully on everything from mobile phones to large desktop displays. Additionally, our components support right-to-left (RTL) layouts out of the box, making them perfect for multilingual sites serving languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and others.

### Production-ready

These aren't prototype components—they're battle-tested, production-ready building blocks used across ILO's digital properties. You're getting the same components that power real-world applications, ensuring reliability and performance.

### Active support and maintenance

The ILO Design System is actively maintained and supported by the ILO's Department of Communication. We're committed to providing long-term support, regular updates, bug fixes, and new features. When you use these components, you're not just getting code—you're getting a partnership in building better digital experiences.
