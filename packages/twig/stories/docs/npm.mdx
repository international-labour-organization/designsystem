# Use as npm package

The Twig Component Library is distributed as a package on npm called [@ilo-org/twig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ilo-org/twig) and can be used in any project that uses Twig as a templating engine.

## Installation

`npm install @ilo-org/twig`

## Structure

The Twig package comes with everything that you need to render Twig components, including JavaScript and CSS.However, it's up to the developer to determine how to bundle and distribute those assets.

### Components

The components are located in the `@ilo-org/twig/dist/components` directory. The component folders are structured like this:

```
ðŸ“¦accordion
 â”£ ðŸ“œaccordion-item.twig
 â”£ ðŸ“œaccordion.behavior.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œaccordion.css
 â”— ðŸ“œaccordion.twig
```

In this example, `accordion.css` has the styles for the accordion component, `accordion.behavior.js` has the JavaScript for the accordion component, and `accordion.twig` is the Twig template for the accordion component.

### Global Stylesheet

You can either bundle the stylesheets for the components into a single file or include the global stylesheet for all of the components:

`@ilo-org/twig/dist/global/styles.css`

### Required Twig extensions

As from 1.2.0 we make use of the `|boolvar` Twig filter: you need to have this filter available in your Twig environment for the component to work correctly. An implementation of the |boolvar Twig filter can be found in the [PHP Syntax for Twig](https://github.com/squirrelphp/twig-php-syntax) project.

## Usage

```twig
{% include '@components/accordion/accordion.twig' with {
  items: [
    {
      title: 'Item 1',
      content: 'Content 1'
    },
    {
      title: 'Item 2',
      content: 'Content 2'
    }
  ]
} %}
```
