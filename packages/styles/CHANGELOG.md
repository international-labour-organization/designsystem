## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 897fe5766: This release includes refactored form components and styles. Whereas before, the Form component took all of the props for all of the form components itself and determined which to render based on data, this release exposes all of the individual form components directly to the developer. The Form component is refactored as a simple wrapper around an HTML form element, which includes a `theme` prop modifying the label and text colors for use on dark backgrounds. Otherwise, it simply provides a layout for different form elements. The Fieldset is used as a layout wrapper to group multiple related form components together, especially theRadio and Checkbox, for which it can also handle error messages. All form components provide access to the underlying form element (usually an `input`) via a `ref` prop.

### Patch Changes

- 8e24e57fc: We've fixed broken exports from @ilo-org/react and ensured that types are exported properly as well. We've upgraded the @ilo-org/react Storybook project to version 7.0.0-beta. This has required us to decouple the installation and build scripts of the react and storybook projects. It's no longer possible to install dependencies and then build both storybook projects together. Instead, users should run `pnpm react:install` or `pnpm twig:install` before building the respective Storbyook project. This should be fixed when Wingsuit upgrades to Webpack5.
