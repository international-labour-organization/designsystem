      description: The items and labels for each tab. Each item takes a `label` property which gives the tag a name, a `component` property which specifies the kind of component the tab should render, and the `componentdata` which contains the data that will be passed to that component. You can also include an optional `icon` component with the name of the icon to render next to the label.

The ILO has 187 member states: 186 out of 193 UN member states plus the Cook Islands.</p> <p>Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries.</p> <figure><img alt='placeholder image' class='right' src='/images/ilo-headquarters.jpg'><figcaption>The ILO's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. ©Steiner SA</figcaption></figure> <h3>ILO Constitution</h3> <p>The driving forces for the ILO's creation arose from security, humanitarian, political and economic considerations.</p> <blockquote> <p>The fundamental ideas that forged the ILO one hundred and three years ago still underpin the global pledge to leave no one behind.</p> <cite>ILO Director-General Gilbert F.
