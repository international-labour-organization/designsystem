# Getting started

This website provides guidance and documentation for the ILO Design System using [React](https://reactjs.org). These docs are a work in progress so bear with us as we add and correct them.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i @ilo-org/react
```

If you plan on using the default styles for the library, then you should also install the `@ilo-org/styles` package.

```bash
$ npm i @ilo-org/styles
```

## Peer dependencies

In order to use this component library, you will need to have `react` and `react-dom` installed as a dependency.

```bash
$ npm i react react-dom
```

## Usage

Components can be exported directly from the `@ilo-org/react` package.

```typescript
import { Button } from "@ilo-org/react";
```

This is fine if you think you're going to use all or most of the components in the library. However, if you're only going to use a few or you want to take advantage of code splitting, then you can import them individually.

```typescript
import { Button } from "@ilo-org/react/Button";
```

## Styles

Styles for the library should be imported at the top of your project.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@ilo-org/styles/index.css" />
```
