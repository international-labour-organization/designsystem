# Breadcrumb

Displays a list of links that can be used to show the user where they are in the website. The first link will automatically be rendered as a Home icon and should usually point back to the homepage of the website.

<div
  style={{
    padding: "30px 20px",
    margin: "25px 0",
    border: "1px solid rgba(184, 196, 204, 1)",
  }}
>
  <Story of={BreadcrumbStories.BasicBreadcrumb} />
</div>

<Source />

## Responsiveness

When the Breadcrumbs reach a certain width compared to the window, they will automatically "collapse" links between the first and last into a clickable ellipsis. The ellipsis is a button that will reveal a context menu containing the collapsed links.

Long link labels will automatically be truncated.

## Gotchas

Placing the Breadcrumb in a container that creates its own [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block#identifying_the_containing_block) could interfere with the rendering of collapsed links in the context menu.

## Default Props

<ArgsTable of={Breadcrumb} />
