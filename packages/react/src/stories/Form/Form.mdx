# Building Forms

Form components in the ILO Design System make it easy to build branded and accessible forms with a minimum of effort. The components are built on top of standard HTML form elements and can be used with most form libraries or validation strategy.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of a form with four text inputs and a submit button. The `<Form>` component is simply a wrapper around an HTML form element. It's primary purpose is to provide standard layout and spacing for form fields. Otherwise, it takes the same props as a standard HTML form element.

```tsx
import { Form, Fieldset, TextInput, Button } from "@ilo-org/react";

function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
  // handle form submission
}

<Form theme="light" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <Fieldset legend="Personal Information">
    <TextInput name="first-name" label="First Name" />
    <TextInput name="last-name" label="Last Name" />
  </Fieldset>
  <Fieldset legend="Contact Information">
    <TextInput name="email" type="email" label="Email" />
    <TextInput name="phone" type="tel" label="Phone" />
  </Fieldset>
  <Button type="submit">Submit</Button
</Form>
```

## Form components

### Names and ids

All form elements must be passed a `name` prop. If you don't also pass in an `id` then it will be set to the same value as the `name` prop.

### Labels and legends

All form inputs include `labels` props that can be used to provide a label for the input. The label size and position can also be adjusted with the `labelSize` and `labelPosition` props. Form elements also include `helper` and `errorMessage` props that can be used to display additional info and error messages to the user

## Grouping components together

### Form

The form provides a simple wrapper around a standard HTML form element. It accepts all the same props as a standard HTML form element, but also accepts a `theme` prop that can be used to set the text color of the form for rendering on light or dark backgrounds.

### Fieldset

The `<Fieldset>` component can be used to group related form elements together. It accepts a `legend` prop that can be used to provide a title for the fieldset. When used with `<Radio>` and `<Checkbox>` components, the `<Fieldset>` component can also be used to show error messages.

## Validation

Form Components expose the standard HTML attributes that you can use for native form validation. For use with libraries, form components also expose a `ref` prop that can be used to access the underlying input elements. We recommend using the [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library for form validation.
