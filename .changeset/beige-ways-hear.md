We're replacing Noto Sans Arabic with Vazirmatn. Noto Sans Arabic had some line-height issues where ascenders and descenders were getting cut off. We unfortunately weren't able to resolve those in a way that would have been consistent with the line-heights were using with fonts in other languages. The best solution we could find was to replace the font altogether with a similar alternative. Other other settings like `font-weight` and styles have remained the same.
