"@ilo-org/react": patch
"@ilo-org/twig": patch
---

We are deprecating the `@ilo-org/utils` package. In this release, we removed the dependency from both the `@ilo-org/react` and `@ilo-org/twig` packages. If you're using `@ilo-org/utils` be aware that it won't be maintained anymore and the values and functions it exported will no longer be used by the Design System.
