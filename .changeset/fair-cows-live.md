**Nav:** This version introduces a new `Nav` component which will eventually take the place of [Navigation](https://twig.ui.ilo.org/?path=/docs/components-navigation-navigation--docs). This version implements the `SubsiteNav` variant, which supports `complex` and `compact` navigation menus for subsites. In future versions, it will support the navigation of flagship sites as well, taking the place of [Navigation](https://twig.ui.ilo.org/?path=/docs/components-navigation-navigation--docs) which will be deprecated.
