- Replaces all of the icons in the Icons package and replaces them with standardised versions that are all the same size, with the minor exception of the `Quote` icon. This required sizing changes to icons and affects the appearance of many components.
- Pattern definitions for `modal` and `tabs` were adjusted to use the new icon settings.
