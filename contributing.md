# Contributing

ILO Design System is an open-source project and we welcome your contributions! Before submitting a pull request, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Branches

| Branch    | Purpose                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `main`    | The latest version of all packages |
| `develop` | The next release of all packages   |

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch
3. Make your changes and [add a changeset](#versioning) identifying the changes and affected packages
4. Push your branch to the forked version of the repo
5. Open a pull request back to the `develop` branch of the main repo

## Versioning

The project uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage package versioning. All pull requests that will affect the project's semantic versioning must include a changest.

See more information on [how to add a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md)

## Conventions

Contributions should respect the following conventions for branch names, commit messages and pull request descriptions

### Commits

Commits should follow [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples:

```
fix(react): change button color on hover
feat(twig): add button component
ci(github): add release workflow
perf(react): improve modal animations
```

#### Types

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Scopes

This should be a package name or an aspect of the project's configuration.

### Branches

Branch names should broadly mirror the same convention as commits.

Examples:

```
feat/react/modal-wrapper
fix/twig/modal-wrapper
```

### Pull requests

Pull requests should include a descriptive name and detailed explanation of what merging the pull request will accomplish. Authors should make sure to reference Github issues that the the pull request will fix or affect.

## Getting started

### Setup

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make sure you have the correct version of node installed.

```bash
nvm use
```

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Check the [package.json](<[../package.json](https://github.com/international-labour-organization/designsystem/blob/1de14fe3a6c3edb8991720b189a870f2f132fc73/package.json#L9)>) to get the correct version. Example:

```bash
npm -i -g pnpm@8.6.0
```

### Installing Storybook dependencies

You can install all of the project dependencies with `pnpm install`. This is sufficient for building the `twig` and `react` libraries.

However, if you want to run the Storybook documentation sites for either `twig` or `react`, you will need to run a specific install script for either package in order to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
pnpm react:install
```

```bash
pnpm twig:install
```

These will clean out all project installation and build files (`node_modules`, `pnpm-lock.json`, `dist/`, etc.) and install all project dependencies for either `react` or `twig`. That includes dependencies for all of the other packages in the project that the `react` and `twig` packages depend on.

### React and Twig Libraries

Build both the `react` and `twig` libraries in one command. Before you run this, you should run the global `pnpm install` command.

```bash
pnpm build:libs
```

### React and Twig Storybooks

Build React Storybook and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm react:build:docs
```

Start React storybook in dev mode

```bash
pnpm react:dev:docs
```

Build Twig Storybook and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm twig:build:docs
```

Start Twig storybook in dev mode

```bash
pnpm twig:dev:docs
```

### Testing, linting, formatting and type checking

Format all code in the repository

```bash
pnpm format
```

Lint all code in the repository

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Check types for all packages in the project

```bash
pnpm check:types
```

Run tests for all packages in the project

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

You can also perform either of the above in a specific package like this:

```bash
pnpm --filter react format
```

### Clean dependencies and build artefacts

Removes all dependencies and build artefacts

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Removes only dependency files (node_modules, lock files, etc.)

```bash
pnpm clean:deps
```

Removes only build artefacts

```bash
pnpm clean:build
```

### Other commands

Checks to see if multiple packages are using different version of the same dependencies

```bash
pnpm check:deps
```
