# Contributing

ILO Design System is an open-source project and we welcome your contributions! Before submitting a pull request, please take a moment to review the following guidelines.

## Branches

| Branch    | Purpose                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `main`    | The latest version of all packages |
| `develop` | The next release of all packages   |

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch
3. Make your changes and [add a changeset](#versioning) identifying the changes and affected packages
4. Push your branch to the forked version of the repo
5. Open a pull request back to the `develop` branch of the main repo

## Versioning

The project uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage package versioning. All pull requests that will affect the project's semantic versioning must include a changest.

See more information on [how to add a changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md)

## Conventions

Contributions should respect the following conventions for branch names, commit messages and pull request descriptions

### Commits

Commits should follow [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Examples:

```
fix(react): change button color on hover
feat(twig): add button component
ci(github): add release workflow
perf(react): improve modal animations
```

#### Types

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

#### Scopes

This should be a package name or an aspect of the project's configuration.

### Branches

Branch names should broadly mirror the same convention as commits.

Examples:

```
feat/react/modal-wrapper
fix/twig/modal-wrapper
```

### Pull requests

Pull requests should include a descriptive name and detailed explanation of what merging the pull request will accomplish. Authors should make sure to reference Github issues that the the pull request will fix or affect.

## Getting started

### Setup

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make sure you have the correct version of node installed.

```bash
nvm use
```

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Check the [package.json](<[../package.json](https://github.com/international-labour-organization/designsystem/blob/1de14fe3a6c3edb8991720b189a870f2f132fc73/package.json#L9)>) to get the correct version. Example:

```bash
npm -i -g pnpm@7.25.0
```

### Installing Storybook dependencies

The `react` and `twig` Storybook projects use different versions of Webpack that don't play well together. That means you'll have to install the dependencies for each of them separately depending on which package you're working on.

**Note:** This should be resolved in the future once [Wingsuit@2.0.0](https://github.com/wingsuit-designsystem/wingsuit) is released, which will use Webpack@5.0.0.

The below commands will clean out all project installation and build files (`node_modules`, `pnpm-lock.json`, `dist/`, etc.) and install all project dependencies for either `react` or `twig`. That includes dependencies for all of the other packages in the project that the `react` and `twig` packages depend on. These are the only install commands that you need.

```bash
pnpm react:install
```

```bash
pnpm twig:install
```

### React and Twig Storybook projects

Build React Storybook and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm react:build:docs
```

Start React storybook in dev mode

```bash
pnpm --filter react storybook
```

Build React library and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm react:build:lib
```

Build Twig Storybook and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm twig:build:docs
```

Start Twig storybook in dev mode

```bash
pnpm --filter twig storybook
```

Build Twig library and dependent packages

```bash
pnpm twig:build:lib
```

### Testing, linting, formatting and type checking

Format all code in the repository

```bash
pnpm format
```

Lint all code in the repository

```bash
pnpm lint
```

Check types for all packages in the project

```bash
pnpm check:types
```

Run tests for all packages in the project

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

You can also perform either of the above in a specific package like this:

```bash
pnpm --filter react format
```

### Clean dependencies and build artefacts

Removes all dependencies and build artefacts

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Removes only dependency files (node_modules, lock files, etc.)

```bash
pnpm clean:deps
```

Removes only build artefacts

```bash
pnpm clean:build
```

### Other commands

Checks to see if multiple packages are using different version of the same dependencies

```bash
pnpm check:deps
```
